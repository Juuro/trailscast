I am Juuro and this is my blog about mountainbiking. Despite I\nalready have a blog [http://blog.i-wars.net] for many years I feel it is finally\ntime to start a seperate blog that's solely dedicated to mountainbiking.\n\nWhat will happen here?\nTo be honest I don't know yet exactly. There's no marketing concept, this is a\nprivate  blog about my favourite hobby. But there are some types of posts you\ncan expect:\n\n 1. There will for sure be race reports. Last season I was present at three UCI\n    Cross Country races. One of them were the world championships in\n    Lenzerheide. The other two were the worldcup races in Albstadt and La\n    Bresse.\n 2. I will write about new products and prototypes I see at those races  or find\n    online. For example in Lenzerheide I did a first shift with the still\n    unanounced electric SRAM XX1.\n 3. This year I bought a new mountainbike (and a new bike for commuting). There\n    will be posts about building up bikes.\n 4. I will do races myself. Most of them are marathon races. I have to tell\n    someone about my expieriences tehre.\n 5. Maybe there will be some tour reports. In the past years I rode once through\n    the alps and I tried to ride from berlin to south Germany - not so\n    successful.\n 6. General cycling topics. While my main interest is about mountainbiking I\n    will also write about other topic that concern cyclists. At the moment the\n    by far biggest par of my cycling is done during commutes. So I will maybe\n    write about other kinds of bikes and more theoretical topics like the\n    \"Zweimeter-Regel\" (A rule in the German state of Baden-Württemberg that\n    forbids ccyclists to use paths less than two meters wide.).\n\nOk, enough with the introduction. Let's go for the first real post.","html":"<p>Hi everyone! I am Juuro and this is my blog about mountainbiking.
