The only problem was\nthat Canyon didn't sell this bike with the SRAM Force 1 shifting.\n\nAfter some hard thinking and many calculations I ended up bying the Roadlite WMN\nCF 7.0 with Shimano 105 shifting. I replaced it with SRAM Force 1 and I had to\nbuy new wheels because the DT Swiss hubs that came with the Roadlite SF 7.0\nweren't compatible with Srams DX driver body. I got DT Swisss ER 1400 wheels.\nThose are even lighter than the carbon rims of the Roadlite CF 9.0.\n\nIn addition to those important changes I also bought my first power meter for\nthis bike. Because of the Sram shifting I decided to pick the Quarq DZero. The\nlast thing I replaced was the saddle. I use now on every bike my beloved (and\nvery light) Tune Speedneedle.\n\nNow I have a truly light (7,4 kg) commuter. I ride it for almost a year now and\nI rode 6212 km with it. I just replaced the chain the first time. It feels like\na really solid bicycle.","html":"<p>In the end of 2017 I started to commute 50 kilometers a day.
